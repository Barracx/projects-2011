Choi and Chang1 and Tracy and Chang2 developed a method for identifying foreign-object
impact on composite plates using distributed built-in piezoelectric sensors

Some examples for the use of piezoelectric
sensors in industry are:
• Measurement of mold cavity pressure
for injection molding of plastics
• Cylinder pressure monitoring on
diesel and gas engines
• Press force monitoring and control
• Monitoring joining forces on automatic
assembly machines
• Monitoring of vibrating machinery
• Process monitoring during machining
